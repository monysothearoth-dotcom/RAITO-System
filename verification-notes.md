# Preview Verification Notes

The integrated Raito-FX Pro home dashboard rendered successfully in the live development preview at a desktop viewport of 1280×720. The dark financial-terminal layout displayed its market ticker, navigation, asset list, AI synthesis hub, setup and news-analysis actions, and status footer without visible clipping in the inspected view.

The same route rendered successfully at a mobile viewport of 375×812. The navigation, account actions, asset selector, analysis cards, and primary calls to action reflowed into a vertically readable layout with no observed horizontal overflow in the captured view.

These checks are visual smoke tests only. Authenticated data writes, scheduled delivery, and external market-provider behavior remain dependent on their configured services and are covered separately by the application test suite and runtime configuration.

## Auto Signal Analyze Verification

The new Auto Signal Analyze route rendered successfully at desktop and mobile sizes. The navigation entry appears directly beside Markets & Chart, while the feature view presents the monitoring state, persistent-signal counters, responsive live-ledger empty state, owner-only confluence controls, and explicit analysis-risk boundaries without observed clipping or horizontal overflow.

The unauthenticated preview correctly shows the public signal ledger while withholding owner-only monitoring controls. Sign-in is required for the owner to enable the recurring monitor or tune its scoring thresholds.

After the indicator-backed scoring and delivery-health update, the final desktop and mobile previews continued to render cleanly. The compact mobile layout preserves the Auto Signal Analyze navigation entry, monitor status, metric cards, ledger, owner boundary, and risk notice in a single readable column.

## Navigation Reorder Verification

The desktop preview shows Auto Signal Analyze immediately after Markets & Chart, with the following feature tabs continuing in the requested analysis-first sequence. The mobile preview preserves the horizontally scrollable header without clipping the first visible tabs; the reordered group remains accessible through the existing touch-scroll navigation. Regression coverage confirms the ordered sequence is Auto Signal Analyze, Signal Analyze, All-in-One AI Engine, AI Agent, and Economic Calendar & News, followed by the remaining functions.

## Header Simplification Verification

The global currency selector has been removed from the header. At desktop width, the reordered feature navigation and account controls now remain visually separate; market-status readouts are deferred to extra-wide screens to avoid a collision with the navigation group.

At the inspected mobile width, the removed currency selector no longer consumes a separate header row. The account controls align below the touch-scroll feature navigation without visible clipping or horizontal overflow.

## Secure Two-Provider Market Data Verification

The Markets & Chart workspace shows the simplified Real-Time Data Feed Integrations panel with only Auto, CoinGecko, and Alpha Vantage choices. The previous Overwrite Provider API Keys inputs and the IEX Cloud option are absent. The panel explicitly states that Alpha Vantage and CoinGecko credentials are managed server-side and are not stored in or returned to browser sessions.

At the inspected mobile size, the simplified provider panel reflows into a single readable column. It retains the provider selector, micro-tick control, server-managed credential notice, and terminal state with no browser API-key inputs or observed horizontal overflow.

The repeated 375×812 Markets preview reconfirmed that the provider panel has no visible Alpha Vantage, CoinGecko, or IEX Cloud key input, no IEX Cloud provider option, and no horizontal overflow. The server-managed credential notice is fully readable in the mobile column.
